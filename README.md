# Logistic Regression

## FOR MANUPULATION  
                    import numpy as np
                    import pandas as pd

## FOR VISUALIZATION 
                    import seaborn as sns
                    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
                    from pylab import rcParams
                  
## Name of the dataset
                    DMV Written Tests
                   
## Shape of the dataset : 
                   (100, 3)

## Aim
                    The aim of this project was to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent, cost function, and logistic regression, of the various learning algorithms without module like sklearn, to get a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.

## Tasks:

                    Defining Logistic Sigmoid Function
                    Computing Cost Function and Gradient
                    Cost and Gradient at Initialization
                    Gradient Descent
                    Plotting the Convergence of Cost Function
                    Plotting the decision boundary
                    Predictions

## For Data Visualization, I used:
                    scatterplot
                    lineplot
